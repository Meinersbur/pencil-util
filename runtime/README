PENCIL runtime support

Building
--------
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

Build requirements
------------------
* PPCG should be installed (runtime requires ocl_utilities.c file from PPCG source directory).
* To make PPCG generate calls to PENCIL runtime functions, the following patch must be applied
  to the PPCG sources before building. A patch for PPCG 0.3 can be downloaded
  from github:
  http://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpproject/benchmarks/9be740d0c1c8cb1ddaa8e58a7274bb44e52cad5e/patches/ppcg/0001-PENCIL-runtime-support.patch

Usage
-----

To make patched PPCG generate call to PENCIL runtime functions, the
--opencl-pencil-runtime
command line option must be provided to PPCG.

Host code, generated by PPCG should be linked with the lib/libocl_pencil_opt.so library.

gcc pencil_host.c -L${PATH_TO_PENCIL_RUNTIME}/lib -locl_pencil_opt -o prog

The generated binary should be executed using the runtime library:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PATH_TO_PENCIL_RUNTIME} ./prog
